1. At Least 4 Pages
This website contains four unique HTML pages: index.html, reviews.html, awards.html, and tools.html. Each page contributes to a cohesive theme centered around River Run Fly Fishing. The homepage introduces the brand, while the Reviews page showcases customer testimonials, the Awards page highlights industry recognition, and the Tools page shares essential gear for fly fishing. All four pages are styled consistently using a shared stylesheet and follow a similar layout, creating a unified and professional appearance across the entire site.
2. Responsive Design
Responsive design was implemented to ensure the website looks and functions well across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout uses relative units such as rem and percentages for padding, margins, and sizing instead of fixed pixels. This ensures that elements scale appropriately based on screen size. Additionally, page components such as headers, sections, and navigation adapt seamlessly, providing a smooth and consistent user experience regardless of the device being used.
3. Media Queries
CSS media queries were used in the styles.css file to enhance responsiveness by applying specific style changes at various screen widths. For example, the navigation menu changes layout on smaller screens to improve readability and accessibility, and text sizes or margins adjust to better fit smaller viewports. These media queries ensure that content remains legible and the interface remains user-friendly whether the visitor is on a large monitor or a smartphone.
4. Navigation Menu
Every page includes a clear and user-friendly navigation menu located at the top of the screen. This menu allows users to quickly access all major sections of the website, including Home, Reviews, and More (containing Awards and Tools). The navigation is designed to stand out with styling that uses contrasting colors and hover effects, helping users understand where they are and where they can go next with ease.
5. Dropdown Menu
The navigation menu includes a dropdown feature under the “More” tab, which expands to show links to the Awards and Tools pages. This dropdown is styled to match the rest of the site and enhances usability by organizing related pages in a way that doesn't clutter the main menu. It makes the navigation cleaner and more efficient, especially as the site scales up and adds more content or pages in the future.
