Div (at least 2)
I used Div to strucutre my webpage to show picutures. I also used it with captions to go along with those picutres to explain what happened. 
Span (at least 2)
I used span to embold certain text within the captions I used to go along with the pictures. I also used it under tatic when explained how the fish was caught the tatic was embolded. 
Audio (at least 1)
I used an audio clip from freesound to show river sounds to what it would be like sometimes out on the water. 
Video (at least 1)
I used a clip from Pexels to show a drone flying up the river to give a sense of what the area looks like.
Iframe (at least 1)
I used the <iframe> tag once in my code to try embedding a Google search result for "The Kingfisher" under the section titled "Need Gear?".
Class (at least 2)
I used the class attribute two times: once for styling each photo section in the gallery using the class "Gallery", and another time to style the audio section using the classes "media-item" and "audio-section" together.
Escape character (at least 1)
 used the escape character once in the iframe URL, where I included the ampersand (&) in the query stringâ€”for example, in parameters like client=safari&rls=en.
