Techniques Used:
Sizing (Width & Height)
How: I used the max-width property for the main content to ensure the content doesn’t stretch too wide on large screens. I also applied padding and margins to create a balanced layout.
Why: The width control ensures that the page content is readable and well-proportioned across devices, maintaining consistency in the layout.
Overflow
How: Although overflow wasn’t explicitly needed in this assignment, if any sections with dynamic content (like images) overflowed, the overflow: hidden or overflow: auto properties could be applied to prevent content from spilling out of the container.
Why: In cases where content is dynamically added or images have set sizes, overflow ensures that content stays within its container and doesn’t break the page layout.
Border
How: I added borders around certain sections using the border property, specifically around the content sections like the main content and individual list items.
Why: Borders are used to visually separate different sections and make the page structure clearer. It adds emphasis and helps organize the content, creating distinct blocks of information.
Margin
How: I applied margins to various sections and list items to ensure there’s sufficient space between different elements on the page. For example, I used margin-bottom on sections to create space between each block of content.
Why: Margins create separation between elements, improving readability and preventing the page from feeling crowded. It also gives the content room to breathe, making the layout more aesthetically pleasing.
Padding
How: I used padding inside sections to create space between the text/content and the section border. For example, the section tag has padding: 1.5rem.
Why: Padding ensures the content isn’t flush with the borders, providing a clean and spacious layout. It enhances readability by preventing text from sticking to the edges.
Display: Inline / Inline-block
How: I used the inline-block display for the buttons (a.button) to make sure they appear next to the text without breaking the layout. This allows the button to behave like an inline element but still maintain block-level styling (such as padding and margins).
Why: Using inline-block for the buttons allows them to be aligned alongside text or other elements, making the layout more flexible while maintaining control over the button’s size and appearance.

Summary of the Techniques Applied:
Sizing: Ensured readability by controlling the width of the main content area.
Overflow: Would be useful for managing dynamic content that might exceed the boundaries of an element.
Border: Used to visually separate sections, adding structure to the page.
Margin: Created spacing between different elements, preventing a cluttered look.
Padding: Added internal spacing within sections to improve text legibility.
Display: Inline / Inline-block: Ensured buttons appeared neatly in-line with other elements, maintaining clean alignment.
Dropdown: Not needed in this assignment but could be useful in more complex navigation or content menus.
Position: Not applied here due to the simple structure of the page.
