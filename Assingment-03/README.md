# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

This semester is going okay, it is my final semester and my classes are making me very stressed. I'm taking a total of eighteen credits which I haven't done before so, that is just a lot for me to handle but it is making be buckle down more and get on top of my school schedule more. I enjoy this class even though I get confused sometimes which is the reason why I am turning this assignment in late. I got confused in Github because it wasn't allowing me to make a README file for some reason but I finally got it figured out. This class will help me in the future by helping me brand myself with my own website for my buissness that I have been working on for ahwile now.
