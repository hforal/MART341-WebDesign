A class that I have truly enjoyed at the university was a class that I took a few years ago called Visions of Doc. A few reasons why I continue to look back on this class is becasue Ive never been apart of something where the enitre class gets together and makes a final product, and in this case it was a film that we made by the end of the semester. We all had to work together to achieve the goal at the end which was difficult to do in such little time.
