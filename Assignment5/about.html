<h1>Why I Chose these websites</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Personal Blog</h2>

<p>Having a personal blog website dedicated to my fly fishing adventures and life as a videographer would be an incredible way to document my passions, share my experiences, and connect with like-minded people. Through storytelling, photos, and videos, I could capture the thrill of casting a perfect line on a misty morning and the behind-the-scenes moments of my creative work in videography. It would serve as a digital journal where I can reflect on my growth in both fields while also providing valuable insights, tips, and inspiration to others who share my interests. Plus, a blog could help me build a personal brand, showcase my work, and even open doors to new opportunities—whether collaborations, sponsorships, or simply making new friends who appreciate the art of fishing and filmmaking as much as I do.</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>

<p>A portfolio website would be the perfect way to showcase my work as both a videographer and a fly fishing guide, creating a professional and visually compelling space to highlight my skills, experience, and passion. As a videographer, I could present my best projects, demo reels, and behind-the-scenes insights, giving potential clients or collaborators a clear sense of my creative style and expertise. At the same time, as a fly fishing guide, the website could feature breathtaking fishing footage, testimonials, trip details, and booking options, making it easy for clients to see what I offer and get in touch. Having a dedicated online presence would help establish credibility, attract new opportunities, and merge my two passions into a cohesive brand, ultimately allowing me to reach a wider audience while doing what I love.</p>

<h2>Small Buissness site</h2>

<p>A small business website would be essential for growing both my fly fishing guiding career and my videography business, providing a professional and accessible hub for clients to learn about my services, view my work, and book directly with me. For my guiding business, the site could showcase stunning fishing locations, package details, client testimonials, and an easy-to-use booking system, making it simple for anglers to plan their next adventure. On the videography side, I could present my portfolio, highlight past projects, and offer service packages tailored to different industries. By combining both careers into one cohesive brand, the website would help me establish credibility, improve visibility through SEO, and create new opportunities for collaborations, sponsorships, and client connections—all while allowing me to share my passion with a broader audience.</p>
