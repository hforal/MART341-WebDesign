# Assingment 3
## How is the course going so far? The semester?

This semester is going *okay*, it is my **final** semester and my classes are making me very **stressed**. I'm taking a total of *eighteen* credits which I haven't done before so, that is just a lot for me to handle but it is making be buckle down more and get on top of my school *schedule* more. I enjoy this class even though I get **confused** sometimes which is the reason why I am turning this assignment in **late**. I got *confused* in Github because it wasn't allowing me to make a README file for some reason but I *finally* got it figured out. This class will help me in the future by helping me brand myself with my own website for my buissness that I have been working on for ahwile now.
