I'm going to furthter the small buissness website. I chose this website for the sake that for where I'm at in my life right now this will benefit me the most. I'm starting my career as a fly fishing guide as well as a freelancer in the photogrpahy and videogrpahy world.

This helped make the audience focus on whats important. Also going along with that you can make there eyes go to certain things first which could get them hooked right away on your page. I used that for my title and thr description right under that. The background color helped being able to read it easier the contrast was nice for the look but also plays a role into making the audience read it as easy as possible but also as much as possible. 

It turned out better than I was thinking, even though I'm not happy with the color combinaiton I think it turned out better than I hoped. I like the balance throughout the page I did well with adding some center headings at the top and as well at the bottom and I think having the contact information at the bottom center is a nice touch. 

I didn't have any issues until the CSS, I had no idea what I was doing. I resulted to the example and had to base mine off of that. When it came to the width part I had a hard time getting that to code directly. But, I worked on it and it turned out well. I solved it by using the example that helped me a lot and also just making sure I had every single letter correct. 

I'm doing well, this class is intersting and I never thought I would have this much fun writing code. It is nice to be working on something of my own like my own buissness. It feels like I'm working toward a goal that I have had for awhile and that is having my own little buissness just like the page I created. The only thing I'm confused about is the new CSS and all of the new coding that came along with that.
