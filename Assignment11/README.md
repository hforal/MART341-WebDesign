Create a page with an external CSS style sheet:
The HTML file links to styles.css through a <link> tag in the <head>, separating content from design for better structure and reusability.
Add hover effects to enhance interactivity:
The .button element has a hover effect applied in the CSS (e.g., color change or shadow), giving users visual feedback and encouraging interaction.
Use an external font that is self-hosted:
A self-hosted font (like Montserrat in your fonts folder) is included via @font-face in the styles.css file and applied to various elements.
Use an external font from a font library:
The Raleway font is loaded directly from Google Fonts using a <link> tag and used for headings or body text to enhance visual hierarchy.
Three Additional Techniques Used:
Experiment with different font styles:
Multiple font families are used — one self-hosted and one from a font library — to create contrast between headings and body text for a dynamic look.
Adjust font-weight for emphasis:
The Raleway font uses font-weight: 700 for bold section headers and 400 for body content, making headings stand out clearly.
Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability:
line-height is used in paragraph styles to make longer text blocks easier to read, contributing to a comfortable visual flow.
