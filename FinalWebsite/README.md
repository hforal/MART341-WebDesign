 Project Process: How I Built on Last Week’s Website
To build on last week’s website, I began by analyzing what was visually lacking and functionally limited. My goal was to enhance the design, increase interactivity, and apply everything I had learned throughout the course. I started by redesigning the layout with a lighter theme and more professional polish. I reorganized the navigation, added a working contact form, and improved page consistency by using a shared layout structure and styles.

Each page was updated with improved visuals (e.g., new hero sections, background images, modern cards), and I incorporated canvas interactivity and responsive features using Bootstrap and CSS media queries. I also removed placeholders like the test page and cleaned up unused content, which made the site feel more finished and intentional.

Learning & Growth
Throughout the project, I significantly improved my skills in:
Programming: Writing cleaner HTML/CSS and JavaScript for dynamic content (like interactive map pins and canvas updates).
Design: Creating better layouts, using Bootstrap components effectively, and paying attention to contrast, spacing, and visual flow.
Planning: Structuring each page to meet project goals, adding custom assets and features in a way that supported usability and consistency.
Transferable Skills I Developed:

Communication: Writing clear, consistent code and improving UI clarity.
Problem-solving: Fixing broken image links and debugging layout issues across pages.
Creativity: Redesigning each page to have visual appeal and a unified theme while adding new, thoughtful touches.
Attention to detail: Ensuring every link worked, image loaded, and layout remained responsive across screen sizes.
Time management: Completing each section iteratively and ensuring functionality by deadline.

 Wins & Lessons
I'm especially proud of:
The new canvas interactive map with location markers and added descriptions when clicked.
The redesigned layout with updated images, backgrounds, and cards that make the site feel much more polished than last week's version.
Fixing image issues and improving consistency across all pages.
Successfully adding a working contact form with a clean UI, which was missing before.
Next time, I would start with a clearer design mockup and spend more time sourcing image URLs in advance to reduce broken links.

Web Presence
This week’s version of the site demonstrates how I:
Improved and maintained the site from its earlier version with a better visual hierarchy, structure, and responsiveness.
Planned updates page-by-page to apply a consistent layout and styling format, making everything feel cohesive.
Used comments and section naming to stay organized and make the code easier to follow or update later.

Technical Skills
The final version of the site shows my proficiency in:
HTML (semantic structure, forms, navigation)
CSS & media queries (style.css reflects light theme, responsiveness, spacing, transitions)
Responsive design (Bootstrap grid system, fluid layouts)
JavaScript (canvas interactivity, map markers with click-to-view info)
Example: The "interactive.html" page now has a canvas with a background image and dynamic dots you can click to learn more about each location—this shows technical growth and problem-solving from last week's version.

Tools & Frameworks
I used:
Bootstrap for layout, cards, buttons, and navbar components.
Visual Studio Code for development with extensions that helped catch errors.
GitHub & GitHub Pages for version control and deployment (if applicable).
These tools helped streamline my workflow and let me focus more on design and interactivity.
 
 Creative Thinking
My design strategy was guided by:
Visual balance and user experience: Card layouts, section padding, image sizing, and hover effects made the site feel alive and intuitive.
Feedback and iteration: From earlier drafts, I revised image placements, added more interactivity, and used lighter colors for a friendlier look.
Real-world inspiration: I looked at travel blogs and tourism sites for structure ideas and replicated clean, simple designs.
