Instructions

Step 1

Ingredients for cookies
Preheat Oven & Prepare Baking Sheets

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats for easy cleanup.


Step 2

Creaming butter and sugar
Cream Butter & Sugars

In a large bowl, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix until combined.


Step 3

Adding dry ingredients to batter
Combine Dry Ingredients

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.


Step 4

Adding chocolate chips to dough
Fold in Chocolate Chips

Gently fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if desired) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.


Step 5

Scooping cookie dough
Scoop Dough onto Baking Sheets

Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.


Step 6

Cookies baking in the oven
Bake the Cookies

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them, as baking times can vary slightly.


Step 7

Cooling freshly baked cookies
Cool the Cookies

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
