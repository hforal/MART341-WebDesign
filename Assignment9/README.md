Materials

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Instructions

Step 1

Ingredients for cookies
Preheat Oven & Prepare Baking Sheets

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats for easy cleanup.


Step 2

Creaming butter and sugar
Cream Butter & Sugars

In a large bowl, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix until combined.


Step 3

Adding dry ingredients to batter
Combine Dry Ingredients

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.


Step 4

Adding chocolate chips to dough
Fold in Chocolate Chips

Gently fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if desired) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.


Step 5

Scooping cookie dough
Scoop Dough onto Baking Sheets

Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.


Step 6

Cookies baking in the oven
Bake the Cookies

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them, as baking times can vary slightly.


Step 7

Cooling freshly baked cookies
Cool the Cookies

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

TIPS:
Use Room Temperature Ingredients: Make sure your butter, eggs, and other ingredients are at room temperature. This ensures they mix together more easily and results in a better cookie texture.
Measure Flour Correctly: Too much flour can make your cookies dry. Use the spoon-and-level method—spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife.
Chill the Dough: Let your cookie dough chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking. Chilled dough helps the cookies keep their shape and enhances the flavor.
Use Good Quality Chocolate: Go for high-quality chocolate chips or chunks. The chocolate is the star of the cookie, so using better quality can make a big difference in taste.
Don’t Overmix: When you add the dry ingredients to the wet ones, mix until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies.
