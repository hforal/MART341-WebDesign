## Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?

Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and navigate the internet by retrieving, interpreting, and displaying web pages. When a user enters a URL or clicks a link, the browser resolves the domain name into an IP address through a DNS lookup. It then sends a request to the web server using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The server processes this request and responds by sending the necessary files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. The browser then parses and renders these files, displaying the content on the screen. This process involves parsing the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM), processing CSS for styling, executing JavaScript for dynamic behavior, and rendering the final layout. Modern browsers use powerful rendering engines like Blink (Chrome, Edge, Opera), Gecko (Firefox), and WebKit (Safari) to handle these tasks efficiently. Behind the scenes, web browsers follow a structured approach to display content. First, the browser parses the HTML document and converts it into the DOM, a structured tree representation of the page. It then processes CSS files, creating a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) to determine how elements should be styled. The JavaScript engine executes scripts interacting with the DOM and CSSOM, enabling dynamic updates, event handling, and animations. Once all elements are processed, the browser calculates their positions on the screen in the layout phase and then paints them onto the display. If any changes occur, such as animations or resizing, the browser may trigger repaints or reflows to update the visible content efficiently.

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a crucial component of how web pages function. It represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like hierarchy, where each element, attribute, and piece of text is a node. The DOM dynamically allows JavaScript to interact with and modify web pages, enabling features like content updates, animations, and event handling. For example, JavaScript can change an element's text, modify styles, or create new elements on the fly. By manipulating the DOM, developers can create interactive and responsive web applications.

## HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?

When comparing HTML, XML, and XHTML, each serves a different purpose. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is primarily used for structuring and displaying web pages. It has a flexible syntax, allowing browsers to tolerate minor errors, and uses predefined tags like <p>, <div>, and <h1>. On the other hand, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is designed to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, XML requires strict syntax rules, is case-sensitive, and allows developers to create custom tags. XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) combines the structure of HTML with the strict syntax rules of XML. It enforces well-formed documents, requires self-closing tags, and is case-sensitive. While HTML is widely used for web development, XML is commonly applied in data storage, and XHTML is an alternative that ensures cleaner, more structured code.
